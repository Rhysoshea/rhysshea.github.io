## Welcome!
Currently I spend most of my time committing to programming projects. These projects have taken many forms, such as my [personal website](https://www.rhysshea.com), learning about the development of Blockchain, and the principles of machine learning, which I will discuss more on this [section](https://programming.rhysshea.com/machine_learning) of my blog.

I encourage you to read on through my website as I will be discussing and sharing new developments in these emerging technologies. I will also be writing about my experience from learning to code as a non computer science degree holder and lessons I have learned from teaching myself to program. Please also share any thoughts and feedback to my site as it is in and of itself a project of its own, so I am always trying to add improvements!
